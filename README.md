This is an addon for [Blender][1], which was desined to extend he [Sverchok][2]
addon by features, that could not be included into Sverchok because it would
add new dependencies and make installation of Sverchok core too complicated for
most usages.

At the moment, all the most interesting and usable stuff is moved into Sverchok
addon itself. Sverchok-Extra still contains some nodes that can be interesting
in certain applications. Sverchok-Extra will continue to exist as a sandbox, or
a nursery, for new Sverchok nodes. If you have an idea for a node, which is too
complex to be a scripted node, but too young, or uses some new dependency, and
you doubt it will be useful in Sverchok core in it's current state â€” put it
into Sverchok-Extra.

**NOTE**: Sverchok-Extra contains nodes that are in early development stage; there are
many things that can change in future. So, please do not depend on this addon
in your production projects yet. But you can already test it and play with it.

The documentation is currently almost absent, partly because of amount of
changes that might occur at any time at this stage of development.
